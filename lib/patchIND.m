% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% This function computes the neighbouring faces (read elements in the case
% of >3D tesselations) and vertices for the input tesselation specified by
% F and V. The function generates matrices whereby row entries correspond
% to vertices and column entries correspond to neighbouring (according to
% the connectivity in the tesselation specified) vertices in the case IND_V
% and faces in the case of IND_F. 
% If formOpt==2 the output arrays IND_F and IND_V are sparse arrays of size
% [size(V,1),size(V,1)] and [size(V,1),size(F,1)] respectively. However if
% formOpt==1 (DEFAULT) or not specified then the output array is instead a
% full array whose size in the column direction is smaller and depends on
% the maximum number of vertex and face neighbours encountered. E.g. in a
% triangulated mesh where each vertex is connected to 6 vertices the array
% IND_V is thus [size(V,1),6] in size. If some locations have less than
% this maximum number of vertices zeros are used to fill up the array. The
% same line of arguments holds for the IND_F array where instead entries
% reflect neighbouring faces.
