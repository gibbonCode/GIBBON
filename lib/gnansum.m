% function [y]=gnansum(A,[],dimDir)
%------------------------------------------------------------------------
% this function is a replacement for nansum which is part of the
% statistics and machine learning toolbox.
% The use of sum with the omitnan flag is used or if this does not work
% (for old MATLAB versions) a custom implementation is used.
