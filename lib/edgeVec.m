% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Computes the edge vectors for the input edges defined by the edge array E
% and the vertices V. The ouput is the allong edge unit vectors N. Other
% optional outputs include the edge vector origins Vp, and the vertex edge
% unit vectors. The latter are an average of both edges connected to the
% vertex.
