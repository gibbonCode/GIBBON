% function [v]=tetVolMeanEst(F,V)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% This function calculates the volume of an ideal regular tetrahedron with
% edge lengths (all equal) that match the mean edge lengths occuring for
% the input surface defined by F (faces) and V (vertices).
