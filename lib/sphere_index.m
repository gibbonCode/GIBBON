% function [I J K]=sphere_index(r)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This function generates the indices 'I',  'J' and 'K' of voxel centers
% found within a sphere of radius 'r' (in voxels). The indices are not
% 'real' indices but are 'centered around zero'. They can be used to
% generate the indices of voxels found inside a sphere around point 'n' by
% adding In,Jn,Kn to I,J and K.
