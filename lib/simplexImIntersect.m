function [regionLabel]=simplexImIntersect(varargin)

% [logicOut]=simplexImIntersect(F1,V1,C1,V2,voxelSize)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This function uses the input simplex (or simplices) defined by F1
% (faces), V1 (vertices), and C1 (boundary labels) to label the vertices V2
% according to what simplex regions they are contained in. The labels are
% stored in the output regionLabel. A vertex inside a simplex region is
% labelled with the boundary label of the simplex region. Vertices outside
% of all simplices are labelled with NaN. Points are labelled based on the
% patch2Im function, i.e. the following steps are used: 
% 1) The simplex is converted to an image where voxels intensities denote
% simplex region labels. (see patch2Im).
% 2) The vertices in V2 are converted to image coordinates in this image
% 3) The image coordinates are converted to image voxel indices
% 4) Voxel indices are used to retrieve the labels from the simplex image. 
%
% The image constructed uses the optional input voxelSize (the default if
% not provided is half of the mean edge size of the input simplex). The
% completeness/accuracy of the labelling depends on the voxel size. Some
% points are labelled as 0 which means they are found inside boundary
% voxels and cannot, based on the current voxel size, be assigned as
% outside or inside a particular region. All vertices labelled as NaN or a
% value >0 are labelled correctly. However some of the vertices labelled as
% 0 may actually be inside a simplex region or outside all simplex regions,
% i.e. 0 denotes that their status is unknown given the voxel size used.
