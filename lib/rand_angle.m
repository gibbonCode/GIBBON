% function a=rand_angle(siz)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This function generates a matrix or array of uniformly distributed random
% angles (of the size siz) in the range [0 2*pi]. The function operates by
% first creating angles in the range 0-pi/2. The angles are next converted
% to unit vectors in the unit circle. The X and Y components of these
% vectors are next independantly and randomly negated. This negating or
% flipping operation causes the vectors to uniformly but randomly span the
% entire cirle. Nexts the vectors are converted to an angle in the range [0
% 2*pi].

%Initial angles in range [0 pi/2]
a_temp=rand(siz)*(pi/2); %Random uniformly distributed angles

%Use angles to generate X component of unit vector. The Y component is not
%needed as the angles themselves are negated later to achieve the same
%effect. 
nX=cos(a_temp); %X components of the random unit vectors

%Flip vectors by randomly negating components
logicFlip_X=randi([0 1],siz)==1; %Logic for flipping X
nX(logicFlip_X)=-nX(logicFlip_X); %Negate X components

%Derive angles for all vectors (now in range -pi pi degrees)
a=acos(nX); %Derive angles in range [0 pi]
logicFlip_Y=randi([0 1],siz)==1; %Logic for flipping Y
a(logicFlip_Y)=-a(logicFlip_Y); %Negate angles to achieve Y component flipping

%Offset so all angles are positive in range 0 2*pi degrees
logicNegative=a<0;
a(logicNegative)=(2*pi)+a(logicNegative);
