% function [F,V,regionInd]=multiRegionTriMesh2D(regionSpec,pointSpacing,plotOn)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This function creates a 2D triangulation for each of the regions
% specified in the variable regionSpec. The mesh aims to obtain a point
% spacing as defined by the input pointSpacing. The triangulation is based
% on a 2D constrained Delaunary triangulation. The constraints are formed
% by the boundary curves inside the regionSpec cell. Large areas, with
% respect to the pointSpacing, will contain a near homogeneous and
% aproximately equilateral triangulations. Other regions (e.g. at
% boundaries and thin/complex shapes) will contain other triangulation
% types. 
% The function output contains the triangular faces in F, the vertices in V
% and the per triangle region indices in regionInd. By setting plotOn to 0
% or 1 plotting can be switched on or off. 
%
% More on the specification of regions:
% Regions are defined as cell entries in the input variable regionSpec for
% instnace region 1 is found in regionSpec{1}. Each region entry is itself
% also a cell array containing all the boundary curves, e.g. for a two
% curve region 1 we would have something like regionSpec{1}={V1,V2} where
% V1 and V2 are the boundary curves. Multiple curves may be given here. The
% first curve should form the outer boundary of the entire region, the
% curves that follow should define holes inside this boundary and the
% space inside them is therefore not meshed. The boundary vertices for
% regions that share boundaries are merged and will share these boundary
% vertices.
