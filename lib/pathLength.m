% function D=pathLength(V)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
%
% This function calculates the "current" curve patch length for each of the
% points of the curve defined by the input argument V. The curve may be
% multidimensional. The output D is a vector of size [size(V,1) 1] whereby
% each entry is defined as the sum of the point-to-point (Euclidean)
% distances (i.e. the curve patch length) leading up to that point. Hence
% it is clear that D(1) is 0 and D(end) is the total curve length.
