% function [D]=patchEdgeLengths(F,V)
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------
% Computes the edge lengths (D) for the patch data specified by the faces
% (F) and vertices (V) arrays. If size(F,2)>2 it is assumed that F indeed
% represents faces. If however size(F,2)==2 it is instead assumed that F is
% an array representing edges. As such it skips the computation of the
% edges array. The edges array used is non-unique by default. See the
% |patchEdges| function for more details if the lengths of a unique set of
% edges is desired.
