% function [R_squared]=R_squared(y,yf)  
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This function calculates the coefficient of determination (R-Squared) for
% the (e.g. measurement) data |y| and the data |yf| (e.g. a model fit). 
% NaN entries in either inputs are ignored.
