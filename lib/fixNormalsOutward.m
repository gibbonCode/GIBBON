%Assumes F and V describe a shape that can be appropirately defined using a
%spherical or polar coordinate system, as indicated by the choice fixOpt.
%For instance a closed spherical shape for open cylindrical shape. 
%
% The function uses the fact that the radius of the normal vector origin
% should be smaller than the radius of the normal vector tip to determine
% whether or not a normal vector needs to be flipped. 

%Derive current face normals

%Vector lengths may need to be scaled, scaling factor should be
%arbitrary if and 100 should work is shape is sufficiently
%spherical. For severly "deformed" or noisy shapes this may
%have to be smaller, but one could argue that then the
%spherical coordinate system mapping is not appropriate.
