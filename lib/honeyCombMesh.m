% -----------------------------------------------------------------------
% This function creates the faces (Fh) and vertices (Vh) for a hexagon
% (honey comb) mesh. The hexagons are created between the limits minV
% (containing desired minimum X and Y coordinates) and maxV (containing
% desired maximum X and Y coordinates). The size of the hexagons is set by
% the desired point spacing.
