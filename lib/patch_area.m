% function [A]=patch_area(F,V)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
%This simple function calculates the areas of the faces specified by F and
%V. The output is a vector A containing size(F,1) elements. The face areas
%are calculated via triangulation of the faces. If faces are already
%triangular triangulation is skipped are area calculation is direction
%performed.
