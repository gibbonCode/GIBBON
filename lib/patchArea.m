% function [A]=patchArea(F,V)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This simple function calculates the areas of the faces specified by F and
% V. The output is a vector A containing size(F,1) elements. The face areas
% are calculated via triangulation of the faces. If faces are already
% triangular triangulation is skipped are area calculation is direction
% performed.
