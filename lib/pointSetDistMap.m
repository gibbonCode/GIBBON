% function [P2i]=pointSetDistMap(P1,P1i,P2,Tw)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This function aims to use a simple distance based weighting to map the
% points P1i (ideally inside or on the cloud defined by) P1 within the
% point cloud defined by P2. A point-to-point correspondence between the
% sets P1 and P2 is assumed such that point displacements are defined
% simple as P2-P1. 
% A weights matrix is derived based on: one over the distance from each
% point in P1 to each point in P1i. Hence this function is inefficient for
% large data sets. The weights are used to set the displacement of the
% points in P1i. The closer a point in P1i is to a certain point in P1 the
% higher its associated weight is for that point and thus the more its
% displacement is based on the displacement of this close point. For zero
% distances points in P1i actually coincide with a point in P1, in this
% case the weights cause them to move to the corresponding point in P2
% exactly. The factor Fw is used to alter the weighting such that closer
% points are favoured. The weights matrix W is adjusted in this fashion
% W=W.^Fw. Whereby the initial W is simply distance based and so Fw=2
% results in a squared distances based mapping.
