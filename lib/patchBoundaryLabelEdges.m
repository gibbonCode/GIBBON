% function [Eb]=patchBoundaryLabelEdges(F,V,C)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This function outputs the boundary edges for the input patch data F, V,
% with face (e.g. color) labels C. Besides the normal patch boundary the
% boundaries of each labelled set are exported as well.
