% function [Im Jm Km Wm]=mask_design(I, J, K, Z)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This function designs the weights for a mask. It assumes the vector 'Z'
% contains the normalised intensities found in a region of interest. The
% mask weight vector 'W' is calculated such that the value sum(W.*Z) is
% minimum when the mask is centered on the region of interest and maximum
% when it is not.
