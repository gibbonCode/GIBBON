% function [cMap]=fireice(n)
% ------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Creates the colormap data for n levels for the fire and ice colormap. Low
% values define a cold blue color while high values define a warm/hot
% color. The extrema of the colordata are the same color. Therefore this
% map is suitable for angular data where 360 may be equivalent to 0
% degrees.
