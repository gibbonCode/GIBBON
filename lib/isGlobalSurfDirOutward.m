%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
% Not the best implementation at present. Vertices are offset allong the
% local normal direction by 1/10th of the smalles edge length. Then the
% volume before and after this operation is calculated. If the volume
% decreased the normals face the wrong way and the face orientation is thus
% flipped for smoothening. Contraction/inflation allong normal directions
% in this way does not always yield valid surfaces and hence volume
% computation may be inappropriate.

% %Compute edge lengths

% %Compute volumes before and after "contraction/inflation" and flip faces if required.
