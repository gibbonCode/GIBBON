function [F,V]=removeNotIndexed(F,V)

% [F,V]=removeNotIndexed(F,V)
% -----------------------------------------------------------------------
% This function takes in a set of indices F (a vector or matrix containing
% indices) into the rows of V and crops V such that only the rows present
% in F are kept. Then the indices in F are fixed such that it contains
% indices for the newly cropped V.
% This function is not specific to patch data but helps in interpretation.
% The names F and V are derived from a patch data type faces (F) and
% vertices array (V). Where the rows in F denotes faces defined by row
% entries in V. Hence this function can be used to remove unused vertices
% from V and to subsequently correct the indices in F. Similarly when
% interpretet in the realm of tesselations F may also define an element or
% edge array.
