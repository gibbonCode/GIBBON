%% REPLACING NUMBERS IN ARRAYS
%%
% An example array
A=[0,-6,3,0,0;-1,-4,-7,-9,-9;-4,-7,11,-5,12;10,-7,5,-7,13;0,11,-2,-6,2;12,4,2,-5,NaN]

%%
% Defining the input array for entries (NaN's allows) that need to be replaced
a=[2 -5 nan 0]
%%
% Defining the numbers (NaN's allows) to take their place
b=[991 992 993 994]; %Numbers to take their place

%%
% Replacing the numbers using |numReplace|
B=numReplace(A,a,b)

%% NOTES ON PERFORMANCE FOR NON-INTEGERS
% The |numReplace| function employs the |ismember| function. Hence it is
% suitable for all number cases where ismember is able to detect
% membership. Numerical precission difficulties may arise for non-integer
% entires. Consider the below: 

logicMember=ismember(pi,pi+eps(pi))
logicMember=ismember(pi,pi+eps(pi)/10)
