%% Syntax
% |changeFileExtensions(pathName,extOld,extNew);|

% extension extNew.

%% Examples

%%
%Create example files in the data/temp directory. Here a set of files with
%the txt extension are created. Later these are changed to have a csv
%file extension.

%Create .txt files
defaultFolder = fileparts(fileparts(mfilename('fullpath')));
pathName=fullfile(defaultFolder,'data','temp','renameCheck');
mkdir(pathName)

n=5;
for q=1:1:n %Create n files
    fileID=fopen(fullfile(pathName,['temp',num2str(q),'.txt']),'w');
    fprintf(fileID,'%d\n',pi);
    fclose(fileID);
end

% Add one additional file with a different extension to show this file will
% not be effected. 
fileID=fopen(fullfile(pathName,'temp.txp'),'w');
fprintf(fileID,'%d\n',pi);
fclose(fileID);

%%
% Show current folder content
disp('Old folder content:')
ls(pathName)

%%
% Change file extensions
extOld='txt'; %Old extension
extNew='csv'; %New extension
changeFileExtensions(pathName,extOld,extNew)

%%
% Show current folder content
disp('New folder content:')
ls(pathName)

%%
% remove the temporary folder created for this example
rmdir(pathName,'s')
