%% Syntax
% |[L]=isGlobalSurfDirOutward(F,V);|

%% Description 
% This function returns a boolean denoting wether surface normals are
% pointing outward (1) (which would result in a positive volume being computed)
% or inward (2) (which would result in a negative volume being computed). 
% The method assumes that the normal directions are coherent across the
% surface. 

%% Examples 
% 

%%
% Example surface
[F,V]=stanford_bunny;

%% 
% Computing a logic denoting whether the normals point outward or inwards.
% For the example surface the normals point outward, so the logical should
% return a true

% This one should be true
[L]=isGlobalSurfDirOutward(F,V)

%%
% However inverting the surface causes the normal directions to point
% inward, hence a false is returned. 

% Reversed should be false
[L]=isGlobalSurfDirOutward(fliplr(F),V)
