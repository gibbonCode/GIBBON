%% gdrawnow
% Below is a demonstration of the features of the |gdrawnow| function

%% Syntax
% |gdrawnow;|

%% Description
% The |gdrawnow| function is similar to the |drawnow| command but also
% activates the |vcw| widget if present for the current figure window.
% Note that activation of |vcw| also hides the axis interactive toolbars. 
% 
% See also: |drawnow|

%% Examples
clear; close all; clc; 

%% Calling |gdrawnow| equivalent to |drawnow|

%% 
% Some example data
[X,Y,Z]=peaks(25);

%%
figure; %Opens default MATLAB figure without vcw button
surf(X,Y,Z); %Visualize something in an axis
axisGeom; %Set axis options for geometry viewing
gdrawnow; %Fully equivalent to drawnow

%% Calling |gdrawnow| to drawnow and also activate existing |vcw| button

%%

cFigure; %Opens a cFigure window which contains the vcw button
surf(X,Y,Z); %Visualize something in an axis
axisGeom; %Set axis options for geometry viewing
gdrawnow; %drawnow + vcw activation

%% Calling |gdrawnow| to drawnow and activate |vcw| repeatedly

%%
% This example shows repeated calls to |gdrawnow| for a figure window e.g.
% when creating subplots. 

cFigure;
for i=1:1:2
    for j=1:1:2
        q=sub2ind([2,2],i,j);
        subplot(2,2,q); hold on;
        surf(X,Y,Z);
        colorbar;
        axisGeom;        
        gdrawnow; %drawnow + vcw activation
    end
end
