%% cFigure
% Below is a demonstration of the features of the |cFigure| function

%% Syntax
% |[h]=cFigure(figStruct);|

%% Description
% Creates a custom figure using the input structure figStruct. The cFigure
% function provides easy control of background color, the color
% definitions, the figure window size (e.g. near maximal), and enables
% figure property cloning. It also allows users to create hidden figures
% which can be made visible for instance using the mfv command. 

%% Examples

%%
clear; close all; clc;

%% 
% Plot settings
fontSize=15;
faceAlpha=0.75;
edgeColor=0.3*ones(1,3);
edgeWidth=1.5;

%% Basic use of |cFigure| and specification of custom figure properties

%Modifying standard figure properties
figStruct.Name='GIBBON'; %Figure name
figStruct.Color='k'; %Figure background color

%Custom figure properties
figStruct.ColorDef='black'; %Setting colordefinitions to black
figStruct.ScreenOffset=0; %Setting spacing of figure with respect to screen edges

[H(1)]=cFigure(figStruct);

%Plot something
surf(peaks(25)); axis equal; axis tight;

%% Creating hidden figures which are made visible using |mfv|
% The below example demonstrates how to create 1 or more figures that
% remain hidden until the |mfv| command is used. This way the figures do
% not "steal focus". This can be an issue sometimes when multiple figures
% are used over time (and with some operational systems). 

%Create property structure
figStructHid.Visible='off'; 

%Open a hidden figure
[H(1)]=cFigure(figStructHid);

%Plot something in it
hs=surf(peaks(25)); 
axis equal; axis tight; colormap jet;
drawnow; 

%Open another hidden figure
[H(2)]=cFigure(figStructHid);

%Plot something in it
hs=surf(peaks(25)); 
axis equal; axis tight; colormap gray;
drawnow; 

pause(2); %Add pause to demonstrate lack of visible figures

%% 
% At this point all figures are hidden so have not stolen focus. The
% figures can be made visible using the |mfv| command:

mfv(H); %Now make all in H visible

%% Calling hidden figures using |scf|

%Create property structure
figStructHid.Visible='off'; 
figStruct.ScreenOffset=300;

%Open a hidden figure without plotting anything in it
[H(1)]=cFigure(figStructHid);

%Open another hidden figure
[H(2)]=cFigure(figStructHid);

%Plot something in it
hs=surf(peaks(25)); 
axis equal; axis tight; colormap autumn;
drawnow; 

%Calling first figure again without making it visible
scf(H(1)); 

%Now plot something in it
hs=surf(peaks(25)); axis equal; axis tight; colormap winter;
drawnow; 

%Now show the figures
mfv; %If this is used instead of mfv(H) then all hidden figures are shown
