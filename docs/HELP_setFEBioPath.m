%% setFEBioPath
% Below is a demonstration of the features of the |setFEBioPath| function

%%
clear; close all; clc;

%% Syntax
% |setFEBioPath(FEBioPathSpec);|

%% Description 
% This function sets the FEBio path defined by FEBioPathSpec. Setting the
% path means it is stored in the GIBBON configuration file:
% /GIBBON/config/FEBioPath.txt. 
%
% See also |getFEBioPath|

%% Examples 
% This example shows how the febio path can be specified and set for use in
% GIBBON

%% 
% The FEBio path should be the full path to the FEBio executable file (and
% should include the extendion for Windows). 

%%
% These are examples of paths defined for Windows and Linux (Ubuntu):
% Windows: 
% C:\Program Files\febio-2.9.1\bin\FEBio2.exe
%
% Linux: 
% /home/kevin/FEBio-2.9.1/bin/febio2

%%
% To avoid this demo from undoing the path settings for a user the current
% path is here instead uploaded with |getFEBioPath|

%Define FEBio path
febioPath=getFEBioPath; % Example: febioPath='/home/kevin/FEBio-2.9.1/bin/febio2'

%%
% Setting the FEBio path
setFEBioPath(febioPath);
