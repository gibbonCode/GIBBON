%% Syntax
% |[L]=isapprox(A,B,tolLevel);|

%% Description 
% This function returns if A is approximately equal to B (to within
% tolLevel) in the form of the logical L. 
% In other words the function simply evaluates: L=abs(A-B)<tolLevel;

%% Examples 
% 

tolLevel=1e-4; % The tolerance level to use

A = - pi; %Example number
B = A + tolLevel/100; % Small difference
C = A + tolLevel*100; % Big difference 
D = A + tolLevel; % Difference equal to the tolerance level

%%
% Using isapprox here should return a true since the difference is smaller
% than the tolerance.
L1 = isapprox(A,B,tolLevel)

%%
% Using isapprox here should return a false since the difference is larger
% than the tolerance.
L2 = isapprox(A,C,tolLevel)

%%
% Using isapprox here should return a false since the difference is equal
% not smaller than the tolerance.
L3 = isapprox(A,D,tolLevel)
