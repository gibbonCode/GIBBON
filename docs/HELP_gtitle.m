%% gtitle
% Below is a demonstration of the features of the |gtitle| function

%%
clear; close all; clc;

%% Syntax
% |hf=gtitle(textString,);|

%% Description 
% The |gtitle| function can be used to create a title at the top of a
% figure window. The title is tied to the figure rather than any axes and
% can therefore be combined with figures with multiple subplots.

%%
% Settings 
titleString='Title on top'; %The title string
fontSize=25; %The desired font size

%%
% Visualize something with a title
