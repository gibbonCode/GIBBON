% Meshing the region

% The input variable regionCell is a cell array containing all the boundary
% curves, e.g. for a two curve region 1 we would have something like
% regionSpec{1}={V1,V2} where V1 and V2 are the boundary curves. Multiple
% curves may be given here. The first curve should form the outer boundary
% of the entire region, the curves that follow should define holes inside
% this boundary and the space inside them is therefore not meshed.
