%% crossProdMat
% Below is a demonstration of the features of the |crossProdMat| function

%%
clear; close all; clc;

%% Syntax
% |A=crossProdMat(a);|

%% Description 
% This function computes the so-called "cross product matrix". The output
% is a matrix A which is a skew-symmetric tensor, which allows for the
% computation of the cross product with the input vector a. In other words
% the matrix A can be used to compute c=A*b which is equivalent to
% c=cross(a,b).

%% Examples 
% 

% Example vector
a=[1 0 0]'

% Compute the cross product matrix
[A]=crossProdMat(a)

% Example vector to compute cross product with 
b=[0 1 0]'

% Use A to compute cross product axb
c=A*b

% Check "traditional" approach
c=cross(a,b)
