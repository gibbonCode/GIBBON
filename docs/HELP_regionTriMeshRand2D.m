%% SIMULATING BOUNDARY CURVES

%Boundary 1
ns=150;
t=linspace(0,2*pi,ns);
t=t(1:end-1);
r=6+2.*sin(5*t);
[x,y] = pol2cart(t,r);
V1=[x(:) y(:)];

%Boundary 2
[x,y] = pol2cart(t,ones(size(t)));
V2=[x(:) y(:)+4];

%Boundary 3
[x,y] = pol2cart(t,2*ones(size(t)));
V3=[x(:) y(:)-0.5];

%% CREATING A REGION MESH
% The input variable regionCell is a cell array containing all the boundary
% curves, e.g. for a two curve region 1 we would have something like
% regionSpec{1}={V1,V2} where V1 and V2 are the boundary curves. Multiple
% curves may be given here. The first curve should form the outer boundary
% of the entire region, the curves that follow should define holes inside
% this boundary and the space inside them is therefore not meshed. 
% All the above is similar to the |regionTriMesh2D| function. Additional
% inputs can be provided here such as SD which is the X and Y standard
% deviation for random point offsets following seeding of points. Hence a
% semi-random point spacing and triangulation is obtained. The mesh is
% still smoothened though which gives points their final locations. 

%Defining a region
regionCell={V1,V2,V3}; %A region between V1 and V2 (V2 forms a hole inside V1)

plotOn=1; %This turns on/off plotting

%Desired point spacing
pointSpacing=0.5; 
resampleCurveOpt=1;
SD=[0.2 0.2];
[F,V,C,DT]=regionTriMeshRand2D(regionCell,pointSpacing,SD,resampleCurveOpt,plotOn);

plotV(V1,'b-','LineWidth',2);
plotV(V2,'b-','LineWidth',2);
plotV(V3,'b-','LineWidth',2);
