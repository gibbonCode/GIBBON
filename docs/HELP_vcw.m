%% vcw
% Below is a demonstration of the features of the |vcw| function

%% Syntax
% |vcw(hf,buttonOpt);|

%% Description
% The vcw function, the view control widget, allows the user to rotate, pan
% and zoom a figure using key presses and mouse gestures. This makes 3D
% view manipulation feel like what one would expect of a CAD package. 
%
% The vcw widget is loaded by default when using cFigure but can be loaded
% for any other figure by using: 
%
% |figure; vcw;|
%
% You can load vcw either before or after creating axes. 
% Once |vcw| is added as a button based widget to a figure window, it can
% be activated by pressing the button or by pressing the |'v'| key. 
% Furthermore calling |vcw|, when the widget is already present, will
% activate it as well. It is recommended to activate vcw once all graphics
% entities and plotting objects have been created. 

%% 
% Once loaded users may press v key to activate widget (or press the
% toolbar button). Press i to show the following help information:
% 
% <<vcw_help_show.png>>

%% Examples
clear; close all; clc; 

%% Using the preloaded view control widget (vcw) in |cFigure|
% A |cFigure| window with the view control widget loaded by default. To
% activate widget press v or click on vcw button in the toolbar. 
% 
% <<vcw_icon_menubar.png>>

%% Use with |figure| 
% The default MATLAB |figure| does not contain the view control widget. To
% load it here the user must enter |vcw;| either before or after axes are
% created. e.g.: 
%%
% |figure; surf(peaks(25)); axis equal; axis tight; vcw;|
%%
% which is equivalent to: 
%%
% |figure; vcw; surf(peaks(25)); axis equal; axis tight;| 

%% Tip
% You can create your own figure function that simply contains |figure;
% vcw;| to create a standard MATLAB figure containing the view control
% widget. 

%% Automatically activating vcw in a script
% Below several examples are provided to automatically activate |vcw| in a
% script. 

%% 
% Some example data
[X,Y,Z]=peaks(25);

%% 
% METHOD 1: Calling |gdrawnow| for a figure window with the |vcw| button
% present

%%
cFigure; %Opens a cFigure window which contains the vcw button
surf(X,Y,Z); %Visualize something in an axis
axisGeom; %Set axis options for geometry viewing
gdrawnow; %drawnow and activate vcw

%% 
% METHOD 2: Calling |vcw| for a figure window with the |vcw| button (same as
% calling |gdrawnow|)

%%
cFigure; %Opens a cFigure window which contains the vcw button
surf(X,Y,Z); %Visualize something in an axis
axisGeom; %Set axis options for geometry viewing
vcw; %Activate vcw

%%
% METHOD 3: By manually changing button state

%%
% The vcw button can be accessed from the figure UserData structure. E.g.
% if hf is the figure handle then the state for the button is found at: 
% |hf.UserData.vcw.buttonHandle.State|

%%
hf=cFigure; %Opens a cFigure window which contains the vcw button
surf(X,Y,Z); %Visualize something in an axis
axisGeom; %Set axis options for geometry viewing
drawnow; 

%Manually toggle to button
hf.UserData.vcw.buttonHandle.State='On'; %Activate vcw
