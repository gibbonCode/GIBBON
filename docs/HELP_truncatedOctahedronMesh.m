% |[F1c,F2c,F1,F2,C1,C2,VT]=truncatedOctahedronMesh(r,nCopies)|

%% Description
% Creates a truncated octahedron mesh where r sets the radias and nCopies
% (a 1x3 vector) sets the number of copies in the x, y, and z direction.
% The output consists of:
%
% F1c, F2c: the hexgonal and quadrilateral face cell arrays (1 cell entry
% per element).  
%
% F1, F2: the hexgonal and quadrilateral face arrays
%
% C1, C2: color/label data for the face arrays
%
% VT: the vertex array
