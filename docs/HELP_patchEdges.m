%% patchEdges
% Below is a demonstration of the features of the |patchEdges| function

%%
clear; close all; clc;

%% Syntax
% | [E] = patchEdges(F,uniOpt);|

%% Description 
% Get the nx2 patch array for the input faces (F) and vertices (V). If
% uniOpt=1 then only unique edges are returned e.g. the edges spanning from
% node 1 to node 2 is the same as from node 2 to node 1. If uniOpt=0 then
% such non-unique edges are also inluded. 

%% Examples 
% 

%%
% Example geometry
[F,V]=geoSphere(1,1);

uniOpt=0;
E=patchEdges(F,uniOpt);

cFigure; 
subplot(1,2,1); 
title('Patch geometry')
gpatch(F,V,'rw','r'); 
axisGeom; camlight headlight; 

subplot(1,2,2); 
title('Edges')
gedge(E,V,'r',2);
axisGeom;
