%% Description 
% The imx (image explorer) function is a GUI to navigate and segment 3D
% image data. 

%% Examples 
%
%% Example: Segmenting MRI data

%% 
% Get a 3D image (see also |dcmFolder2MATobject| to import DICOM data)
testCase=2; 

defaultFolder = fileparts(fileparts(mfilename('fullpath'))); %Set main folder
loadSavePath=fullfile(defaultFolder,'data','imseg'); %Path for loading and saving segmentation data
switch testCase
    case 1 %MATLAB brain data
        load mri;
        M=squeeze(D); %example image data set
        v=2./[1,1,.4]; %example voxel size
    case 2 %MRI imported from DICOM files, see also HELP_dcmFolder2MATobject        
        pathName=fullfile(defaultFolder,'data','DICOM','0001_human_calf');        
        loadName=fullfile(pathName,'IMDAT','IMDAT.mat');
        
        IMDAT_struct=load(loadName); %The image data structure 
        G = IMDAT_struct.G; %Geometric/spatial information
        v = G.v; %The voxel size
        M = IMDAT_struct.type_1; %The image data
end

% *Viewing*
% 
% * _Toolbar_ - Note all functions displayed in the graphical user
% interface toolbar, equipt with an information panel and descriptions
% of keyboard shortcuts just below the toolbar.
% Instructions for each widget will appear along this top bar when in use.
% Right click to exit from any given widget.
% 
% * _View manipulation_ - Use the View Control Widget to zoom, pan, and
% rotate a figure using different mouse gestures (right mouse button
% for zoom, left for panning, and middle/scroll for rotating).
% Use the sliding bars on the left hand side of the graphical user
% interface to change slice view from all 3 axes.
% Press home to return to active slice.
% Use the colorbar button to change the limits of the color axis displayed
% below the slice, shifting the color contrast across a slice and
% increasing the visibility of contour lines.
% 
% <<HELP_imx_View.gif>>
% 
% *Sketching a contour*
% 
% * _Sample_ - Begin segmenting an element with s = sample sketch contour.
% With the activated widget, click on an area of contrast that outlines the
% element to generate an approximate dotted contour. If the generated outline is
% unsuitable, click elsewhere along the contrast to produce a new contour.
% Once the sample contour is acceptable, right click out of the
% widget. See below for an example of this process in segmenting the skin.
% 
% <<HELP_imx_Sample.gif>>
% 
% * _Cut_ - Use c = cut sketched contour to edit a sample sketch by
% boxing and removing an incorrect section of the outline.
% 
% <<HELP_imx_Cut.gif>>
% 
% * _Draw_ - After cutting a portion of a sample sketch, use the drawing 
% tool to complete the sketch if needed. Use d = draw contour to
% place connected sketch points along a contour where the path needs to be filled in.
% After exiting the widget, observe that the drawn sketch will be in a
% different color compared to the original.
% 
% <<HELP_imx_Draw.gif>>
% 
% * _Adjust_ - To edit the alignment of certain points along a bad contour,
% use the adjust tool. To move a sketch point to a new location, click on
% the point and then click on its new placement.
% 
% <<HELP_imx_Adjust.gif>>
% 
% * _Delete_ - Use the delete tool to erase any sketch contour on the
% slice.
% 
% <<HELP_imx_Delete.gif>>
% 
% 
% *Accepting a contour*
%
% * _Select_ - Once a sketch contour is well fit to an element on the given
% slice, use a = accept contour to select the contour, changing it to a
% solid green path. If multiple sketches exist on the slice, select your
% desired option from the displayed window to either add a new contour,
% merge with another contour, or replace the existing accepted contours.
% See below for an example of merging multiple contours of interest.
% 
% <<HELP_imx_Accept.gif>>
% 
% * _Convert_ - Use the convert button to easily switch from an accepted
% contour back to a sketch contour if further adjustments are needed. Use
% the reset button to return to the original, unsegmented slice.
% 
% <<HELP_imx_Convert.gif>>
% 
% * _Grow/Shrink_ - Use + = grow contour and - = shrink contour to
% manipulate the size of an accepted contour to best fit a given element.
% Growing and shrinking contour lines will likely wrinkle the path and
% require smoothing (see Smooth).
% 
% <<HELP_imx_GrowShrink.gif>>
% 
% * _Smooth_ - Use q = smooth accepted contour to smoothen a contour path.
% If more extreme smoothing is necessary, press p while the smoothing tool
% is activated to adjust the smoothing parameter accordingly.
% 
% <<HELP_imx_Smooth.gif>>
% 
% *Finalizing segmentation* - After the slice is complete, press space to
% go to the next slice and continue segmentation for all MRI slices.
% Periodically check the view of all slices using the showHide tool to
% verify continuity along the length of an element until completion.
