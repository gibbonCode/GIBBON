%% Syntax
% |[CM]=fourthOrderMat(C);|

%% Description 
% Converts a 3x3x3x3 4th order tensor to a 9x9 matrix

%% Examples 
% 

%%
% Creating the stiffness tensor for Hooke's law of linear elasticity

%Constructing 4th order base tensor set
I=eye(3,3); %The 2nd order identity tensor
II1=dyadicProduct(I,I,1); %4th order base tensor 1                                                                
II3=dyadicProduct(I,I,3); %4th order base tensor 3

%Parameters for Hooke's law
mu=1; %The shear modulus
lambda=5; %The lambda lame parameter
C=lambda.*II1+2.*mu.*II3; %Construct 4th order stiffness tensor
