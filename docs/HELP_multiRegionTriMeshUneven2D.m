%% CREATING MULTI-REGION MESHES
% The first step is to define regions. Regions are defined as cell entries.
% for instance a cell called regionSpec. Each entry in regionSpec defines a
% region i.e. region 1 is found in regionSpec{1}. Each region entry is
% itself also a cell array containing all the boundary curves, e.g. for a
% two curve region 1 we would have something like regionSpec{1}={V1,V2}
% where V1 and V2 are the boundary curves. Multiple curves may be given
% here. The first curve should form the outer boundary of the entire
% region, the curves that follow should define holes inside this boundary
% and the material inside them is therefore not meshed. The boundary
% vertices for regions that share boundaries are merged and will share
% these boundary vertices. The function output contains the triangular
% faces in F, the vertices in V and the per triangle region indices in
% regionInd. 

%Defining 4 regions
regionSpec{1}={V1,V2}; 
regionSpec{2}={V2,V3}; 
regionSpec{3}={V3}; 
BoundaryPointSpacings{1}={0.75,0.5}; %A region between V1 and V2 (V2 forms a hole inside V1)
BoundaryPointSpacings{2}={0.5,0.25}; %A region bound by V2 containing a set of holes defined by V3 up to V6
BoundaryPointSpacings{3}={0.25}; %A region bound by V2 containing a set of holes defined by V3 up to V6
MeshPointSpacings=[0.75 0.5 0.25];

plotOn=1; %This turns on/off plotting

%Desired point spacing
[F,V,regionInd]=multiRegionTriMeshUneven2D(regionSpec,BoundaryPointSpacings,MeshPointSpacings,plotOn);
% [F,V,regionInd]=multiRegionTriMesh2D(regionSpec,pointSpacing,plotOn);
% plotV(V1,'b-','LineWidth',2);
